- probably want postman for ease of post requests
- get endpoint -> lookup from C*
- post endpoint -> insert to C*
- validation on post request
- example validaion on lookup maybe?
- make some fancy logic fam.

- cassandra db : itemId, cost, name, inventoryCount, basePrice, lastUpdatedTimestamp
- keys would probably be itemId, name(?)

- probably like make proper comments idk
- set up testing at some point - junit+mockito
